# Holo - MAGNATHON

Digital displays have changed the paper industry. Likewise, we see a huge
possibility for holograms in sustainable development. We - team Big-Zero - are
planning to make a simple and easy (DIY) and interactive hologram which helps to
get the hologram experience to more people. we are planning to achieve this using
a mobile app (which will have features such as hand tracking) and with some
specially designed glasses (instead of flat glasses we are planning to use spherical
shape glasses).

## How it Works ?
We display the image in the android app onto a curved glasss, and use hand tracking to make it more interactive.

## Technologies used
Java
Mediapipe

## How to configure
clone `https://github.com/jiuqiant/mediapipe_multi_hands_tracking_aar_example` and replace the `MainActivity.java` and `activity_main.xml`.

## How to Run
Build apk in android studio. Then install it in an android smartphone and run the app. Place the screen opposite to a the inside shpere shaped glass. Look from behind and you will feel like the reflection is floating. You can make an 'O sign' with your thumb and index finger on the reflection (in the vicinity of front camera) and the digit will change.
