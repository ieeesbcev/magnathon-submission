Tell us about your project here
The energy requirement is increasing on a very large scale at the same time energy wastage is also prevailing so we have developed something which promotes energy saving, sustainability and contributes to the economy.We plan to promote energy saving by establishing reward systems, if the consumer manages to reduce their power consumption then they are awarded reward points which they can redeem via different platforms.The idea is to implement it at individual level because its more easier to go from an individual level to large scale rather than the opposite.
